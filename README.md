# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
  1.  Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
  2.  Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
  3.  Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
  4.  Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
  5.  Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

## Purpose

   Create a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for muliple criteria at once. Adding a table to filter through the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. 

## Results

  •	A cleared search provides information for all UFO sightings, including date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and commentary
  •	The site populates all matches when a city is entered in the filter search.
  •	The site populates all matches when a state is entered in the filter search.
  •	The site populates all matches when a country is entered in the filter search.
  •	The site populates all matches when a shape is entered in the filter search.
  •	The site populates all matches when a date is entered in the filter search.


## Summary

  Drawbacks
    - The search criteria are case sensitive and must match the information to appear.
    - The website information cannot be exported into an Excel spreadsheet, or other friendlier programs.
    - Users must be aware of specific information that they need to filter by.
    
  Recommendations

    1. Create a filter section that is not case sensitive and is flexible to populate information if it is correct.
    2. Adding a filter on the date range to include ranges, as opposed to specific MM/DD/YY entries
    3. Provide an option for information to be exported to Excel or other user-friendly programs
